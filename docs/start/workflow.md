A session is one conversation with the lead. You type a task; the lead hands
pieces to sub-agents that run in the background, and you keep talking to it.

## When the lead delegates

Work in one directory, within the lead's budget of changed source lines, the
lead does itself: on a five-part task in one Go package it answered in 5
requests at the median, against 11 when it spawned. Work that spans more
directories goes to sub-agents, and each starts clean with only the rules
for its piece. A language sub-agent such as `go-dev` is sent back until its
checks ran after its last edit. A report tofu reads as clean is answered
from; any other the lead checks itself before it answers. With five
sub-agents running at once, a task's first turn took 4 min 58 s, against
21 min 18 s when none overlapped.

## Keys

**Alt+2** opens the sub-agents feed, **Alt+3** the file edits, **Alt+4** the
shells. **Esc** or the first **Ctrl+C** stops only the lead's turn.
`tofu --continue` reopens the last session.

## Commands

```
tofu session list|info|trace|reads|resume|rename <name|id> [--json]
